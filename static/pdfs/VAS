Here are some answers to common questions: <br>
•	You will subscribe directly to the merchant via their site linked from here. <br>
•	Your subscription will not appear on an AT&T bill. We will charge your card directly.<br>
•	Regular data rates still apply if you use a subscription from your mobile device. For example, a movie streaming service still uses data; the deal is on the subscription price only.<br>
•	You can come back here easily to see or cancel subscriptions. <br>
•	Cancelling your AT&T service will not impact your subscription services. However, discounts will be removed from your subscription with the next renewal. <br>[MSG_LINE_BR~05000]" fillcolor=lightyellow fontsize=9 shape=rectangle style=filled]
